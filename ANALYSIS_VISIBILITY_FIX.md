# Analysis Visibility Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The analyses were not appearing in the UI due to a **cascade delete problem** caused by the auto-cleanup feature. Here's what was happening:

1. ✅ **Upload created** - File uploaded successfully to R2 storage and database
2. ✅ **Analysis created** - Analysis record created in database with status "PENDING"  
3. ✅ **Analysis processing** - Background analysis completes successfully
4. ✅ **Analysis results saved** - Results stored in database with status "COMPLETED"
5. ❌ **Auto-cleanup deletes upload** - Upload record deleted from database
6. ❌ **Cascade delete removes analysis** - Due to `onDelete: Cascade` in schema, analysis gets deleted too
7. ❌ **UI shows no analyses** - Frontend can't find any analyses to display

## Root Cause
The Prisma schema had a cascade delete relationship:
```prisma
model Analysis {
  // ...
  upload Upload @relation(fields: [uploadId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

When the auto-cleanup feature deleted the upload record, it automatically deleted all related analyses due to the cascade rule.

## Solution Applied
Modified the `cleanupUploadedFile` function to only delete the file from R2 storage, but **keep the upload record in the database** for analysis history:

### Before (Problematic):
```typescript
async function cleanupUploadedFile(uploadId: string) {
  // Delete file from R2
  await r2.send(new DeleteObjectCommand({ ... }));
  
  // Delete upload record from database ❌ THIS CAUSED CASCADE DELETE
  await DatabaseStorage.deleteUpload(uploadId); 
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
async function cleanupUploadedFile(uploadId: string) {
  // Delete file from R2 storage only
  await r2.send(new DeleteObjectCommand({ ... }));
  
  // Keep upload record in database for analysis history ✅
  Logger.info('[Analyze API] Kept upload record for analysis history:', uploadId);
}
```

## Files Modified
- **`/src/app/api/analyze/route.ts`** - Updated cleanup logic to preserve database records

## Benefits of This Fix
1. **Analysis History Preserved** - All completed analyses remain visible in the UI
2. **Storage Optimized** - Large files are still deleted from R2 to save storage costs
3. **Metadata Retained** - Upload information (filename, size, etc.) available for analysis context
4. **No Breaking Changes** - Existing functionality remains intact

## Verification Steps
1. Upload a file → Upload record created ✅
2. Analysis runs → Analysis completed ✅  
3. Auto-cleanup runs → File deleted from R2, upload record kept ✅
4. Check UI → Analysis visible with results ✅

## Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **Remove cascade delete** - Would require schema migration and could leave orphaned records
2. **Disable auto-cleanup** - Would consume more storage space over time  
3. **Separate cleanup job** - More complex, requires additional infrastructure
4. **Current solution** - Minimal code change, preserves functionality ✅

## Current Status
- ✅ BigInt serialization fixed (from previous issue)
- ✅ Analysis visibility fixed (cascade delete issue resolved)
- ✅ Upload/analysis flow working end-to-end
- ✅ Database migration to PostgreSQL complete
- ✅ File storage optimized (files deleted, metadata preserved)

The application should now show completed analyses in the UI while still managing storage efficiently.
