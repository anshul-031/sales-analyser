# Polling Rate Limiting Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The polling system was triggering too many backend API calls simultaneously, without proper enforcement of the minimum 1-minute interval between API calls. Multiple issues were identified:

1. **No Global Rate Limiting**: Each polling instance managed its own rate limiting, leading to multiple API calls from different components
2. **Insufficient Interval**: The 1-minute interval was too aggressive for production use
3. **Race Conditions**: Multiple polling timers could execute simultaneously
4. **No Cross-Component Coordination**: Different components could all poll at the same time

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Global Polling Manager
Created a singleton `GlobalPollingManager` class to coordinate all polling across the entire application:

```typescript
class GlobalPollingManager {
  private lastGlobalPollTime = 0;
  private activePollers = new Set<string>();
  private currentlyPolling = false;
  private readonly MIN_GLOBAL_POLL_INTERVAL = 60000; // 1 minute globally
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Single Source of Truth**: Only one poll can execute across all components
- **Global Rate Limiting**: Enforces minimum 1-minute gap between ANY API calls
- **Active Tracker**: Monitors how many polling instances are active
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Prevents concurrent polling operations

### 2. Enhanced Rate Limiting
Implemented multiple layers of protection:

- **Global Level**: Minimum 1 minute between any API calls across the entire app
- **Instance Level**: Each poller instance has its own lifecycle management
- **Visibility Checks**: Only polls when components are visible and enabled
- **Conservative Intervals**: Increased base interval from 1 minute to 2 minutes

### 3. Updated Configuration
Made polling intervals more conservative:

```typescript
export const POLLING_CONFIG = {
  // Increased from 1 minute to 2 minutes
  ANALYSIS_STATUS_INTERVAL: 120 * 1000, // 2 minutes
  MAX_POLLING_DURATION: 30 * 60 * 1000, // 30 minutes
  VISIBILITY_DEBOUNCE_DELAY: 500, // 500ms
} as const;
```

### 4. Improved Logging
Enhanced debugging with detailed logging:

- **Poller Registration**: Track when pollers start/stop
- **Rate Limiting**: Log when calls are blocked due to rate limits
- **Global Stats**: Monitor total active pollers and last poll time
- **Error Handling**: Better error tracking and reporting

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. **`/src/lib/usePolling.ts`** - Complete rewrite with global manager
2. **`/src/lib/constants.ts`** - Updated polling intervals

### Key Changes:

#### Global State Management:
- Singleton pattern ensures only one manager instance
- Tracks all active polling instances
- Prevents concurrent API calls

#### Conservative Intervals:
- Base interval: 1 minute â†’ 2 minutes
- Minimum global interval: 1 minute (enforced globally)
- Maximum duration: 30 minutes (unchanged)

#### Enhanced Safety:
- Multiple validation layers before making API calls
- Graceful handling of multiple component instances
- Automatic cleanup on component unmount

## Benefits

### 1. **Guaranteed Rate Limiting**
- **Before**: Multiple 1-minute timers could fire simultaneously
- **After**: Maximum 1 API call per minute across entire application

### 2. **Reduced Server Load**
- **Before**: Potential for N simultaneous API calls (N = number of components)
- **After**: Maximum 1 API call at any given time

### 3. **Better Resource Usage**
- **Before**: Redundant API calls wasting bandwidth and server resources
- **After**: Optimized API usage with shared results

### 4. **Improved Reliability**
- **Before**: Race conditions and unpredictable polling behavior
- **After**: Predictable, coordinated polling with proper sequencing

### 5. **Enhanced Monitoring**
- **Before**: Limited visibility into polling behavior
- **After**: Comprehensive logging and statistics

## Expected Behavior

### Normal Operation:
```
[GlobalPolling] Registered poller poller-abc123, total active: 1
[GlobalPolling] poller-abc123 - Executing poll (1 active pollers)
[GlobalPolling] poller-abc123 - Poll completed successfully
[GlobalPolling] poller-def456 - Rate limited, need to wait 45s more
```

### Multiple Component Scenario:
```
[GlobalPolling] Registered poller poller-call-history, total active: 1
[GlobalPolling] Registered poller poller-analysis-tab, total active: 2
[GlobalPolling] poller-call-history - Executing poll (2 active pollers)
[GlobalPolling] poller-analysis-tab - Already polling in progress, skipping
```

### Rate Limiting in Action:
```
[GlobalPolling] poller-xyz789 - Rate limited, need to wait 38s more
[Polling] poller-xyz789 - Not visible, skipping poll
[GlobalPolling] poller-xyz789 - Executing poll (1 active pollers)
```

## Configuration

The system can be tuned via constants:

```typescript
// Adjust base polling interval
ANALYSIS_STATUS_INTERVAL: 120 * 1000, // 2 minutes

// Adjust maximum polling duration
MAX_POLLING_DURATION: 30 * 60 * 1000, // 30 minutes

// Adjust global minimum interval in GlobalPollingManager
MIN_GLOBAL_POLL_INTERVAL: 60000, // 1 minute
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Single Component**: Verify 2-minute intervals are respected
2. **Multiple Components**: Confirm only one API call per minute globally
3. **Visibility Changes**: Test polling pause/resume behavior
4. **Component Unmounting**: Verify proper cleanup
5. **Rate Limiting**: Confirm blocked calls are logged appropriately

## Monitoring

Monitor these logs in production:
- `[GlobalPolling]` messages for rate limiting effectiveness
- Active poller counts to understand usage patterns
- Rate limiting blocks to tune intervals if needed
- Poll success/failure rates

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing polling behavior is preserved
- Components using `usePolling` continue to work unchanged
- Enhanced rate limiting is transparent to consumers
- Configuration changes are optional and have safe defaults

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Intervals**: Adjust intervals based on analysis status
2. **Priority Queuing**: Allow urgent polls to bypass normal queuing
3. **Batch Processing**: Combine multiple poll requests into single API call
4. **Circuit Breaker**: Temporarily disable polling on repeated failures
5. **Analytics**: Track polling patterns for optimization

This fix ensures that backend API calls are strictly limited to a maximum of one call per minute globally, eliminating the previous issue of simultaneous API calls while maintaining all existing functionality.
