# DELETE Upload Feature Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented the ability to delete uploaded files and their associated analyses in the AI Call Analyzer application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Upload API Route (`src/app/api/upload/route.ts`)
- Added `DELETE` method to handle file deletion requests
- Implemented proper authentication and authorization checks
- Added file removal from Cloudflare R2 storage
- Database deletion with cascade handling for related analyses
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 2. Updated Postman Collection (`postman/AI_Call_Analyzer_API.postman_collection.json`)
- Added "Delete Upload" endpoint for testing
- Positioned logically after "Get Uploaded Files"
- Includes proper test scripts to verify successful deletion
- Uses collection variables for easy testing

## API Endpoint Details

### DELETE /api/upload?id={uploadId}
**Purpose**: Delete an uploaded file and all associated analyses

**Authentication**: Required (Bearer token or session)

**Parameters**:
- `id` (query parameter): The ID of the upload to delete

**Response Codes**:
- `200`: Upload deleted successfully
- `400`: Missing upload ID
- `401`: Authentication required
- `403`: Not authorized to delete this upload
- `404`: Upload not found
- `500`: Server error

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Upload deleted successfully"
}
```

## Database Relationships
The implementation leverages Prisma's cascade delete functionality:
- Deleting an Upload automatically deletes:
  - All related Analysis records
  - All AnalysisInsight records (through Analysis)
  - All CallMetrics records (through Analysis)

## File Storage
- Files are removed from Cloudflare R2 storage
- Graceful handling if R2 deletion fails (continues with database deletion)
- Uses the stored `fileUrl` from the upload record as the R2 object key

## Security Features
- User authentication required
- Authorization check: users can only delete their own uploads
- Comprehensive error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Testing
Use the provided Postman collection to test the delete functionality:
1. First upload a file using "Upload Audio Files"
2. Note the upload ID from the response
3. Use "Delete Upload" to remove the file
4. Verify the file is gone using "Get Uploaded Files"

## Error Resolution
This implementation fixes the 405 "Method Not Allowed" error that was occurring when attempting to delete uploads, as the DELETE method was not previously implemented in the API route.

## Next Steps
- Consider adding bulk delete functionality
- Add soft delete option (mark as deleted instead of permanent removal)
- Implement file recovery/restore functionality
- Add audit logging for deletion activities
