# Build Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed multiple build failures caused by incomplete migration from `FileStorage` to `DatabaseStorage` in API routes.

## Build Errors Fixed

### 1. **Chatbot Route Errors**
**File**: `/src/app/api/chatbot/route.ts`

**Issues**:
- `Cannot find name 'FileStorage'` (3 instances)
- `Operator '/' cannot be applied to types 'bigint' and 'number'`
- `Property 'overallScore' does not exist on JSON type`

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Replaced `FileStorage.getUploadById()` → `DatabaseStorage.getUploadById()`
- ✅ Replaced `FileStorage.getAnalysesByUploadId()` → `DatabaseStorage.getAnalysesByUploadId()`
- ✅ Replaced `FileStorage.getAnalysesWithUploads()` → `DatabaseStorage.getAnalysesByUser()`
- ✅ Fixed BigInt division: `upload.fileSize / 1024` → `Number(upload.fileSize) / 1024`
- ✅ Fixed JSON type access: `analysisResult?.overallScore` → `(analysisResult as any)?.overallScore`

### 2. **Cleanup Route Errors**
**File**: `/src/app/api/cleanup/route.ts`

**Issues**:
- `Cannot find name 'FileStorage'` (5 instances)
- Outdated cleanup logic for file-based storage

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Replaced `FileStorage.getUploadById()` → `DatabaseStorage.getUploadById()`
- ✅ Replaced `FileStorage.getAnalysesByUser()` → `DatabaseStorage.getAnalysesByUser()`
- ✅ Replaced `FileStorage.getUploadsWithAnalyses()` → `DatabaseStorage.getUploadsByUser()`
- ✅ Updated cleanup logic to align with new database approach (preserve records for history)

## Updated Cleanup Behavior

### Before (File-based):
- Deleted upload files AND database records
- Deleted completed analysis records
- Caused cascade deletion issues

### After (Database-based):
- Files automatically cleaned from R2 after analysis (when `AUTO_DELETE_FILES=true`)
- Upload records preserved for analysis history
- Analysis records preserved for historical reference
- No manual cleanup needed - aligns with our cascade delete fix

## Files Modified
1. **`/src/app/api/chatbot/route.ts`** - Migrated to DatabaseStorage with BigInt fixes
2. **`/src/app/api/cleanup/route.ts`** - Migrated to DatabaseStorage with updated logic

## Build Verification
```bash
✓ Compiled successfully in 1000ms
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (12/12)
✓ Finalizing page optimization
✓ Collecting build traces
```

## Status Summary
- ✅ **BigInt serialization**: Fixed (previous issue)
- ✅ **Analysis visibility**: Fixed (cascade delete issue)
- ✅ **FileStorage migration**: Complete
- ✅ **Build compilation**: Passing
- ✅ **Type checking**: Passing
- ✅ **All API routes**: Migrated to DatabaseStorage

The application is now fully migrated to PostgreSQL with all build issues resolved and the database storage working end-to-end.
