## Integration Points

### Database Integration
- Uses existing Prisma schema
- Leverages Upload and Analysis models
- Maintains data relationships and constraints

### AI Integration
- Uses existing Gemini AI service
- Leverages `generateChatbotResponse` method for text analysis
- Maintains rate limiting and error handling

### File Storage Integration
- Works with existing R2/Cloudflare storage
- Handles audio file identification
- Supports transcription data retrieval

## Error Handling

### Fixed Issues
1. **React Object Rendering Error**: Fixed by ensuring analysis results are properly formatted as strings
2. **TypeScript Interface Errors**: Updated interfaces to match actual data structure
3. **API Response Handling**: Proper error states and loading management

### Current Error Handling
- Network request failures
- API response validation
- Empty state management
- Loading state management

## Enhanced Selection System (NEW IMPROVEMENTS)

### Multiple Selection Options

2. **Select All Button**: Prominent button in filter section with recording count
3. **Master Checkbox**: Header checkbox to select/deselect all visible recordings  
4. **Clear Selection**: Dedicated button when partial selection exists
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
   - `Ctrl/Cmd + A`: Select all visible recordings
   - `Escape`: Clear current selection

### Visual Feedback
- **Selection Counter**: Shows "X of Y selected" in real-time
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Blue buttons for selection actions
  - Red buttons for deselection actions
  - Indigo highlight for selected recordings
- **Smart Button States**: Buttons adapt based on current selection state
- **Tooltips**: Helpful hints showing keyboard shortcuts

### User Experience Improvements
- **No More One-by-One Selection**: Users can easily select all recordings at once
- **Multiple Selection Methods**: Choose the most convenient method for their workflow
