# Advanced Audio Compression Feature

This document describes the new client-side audio compression feature that provides maximum compression for call recordings before upload.

## Overview

The Sales Analyzer now includes advanced audio compression capabilities that process audio files on the client side before uploading. This feature significantly reduces file sizes while maintaining sufficient quality for call analysis and transcription.

## Features

### üéõÔ∏è Compression Presets

The system includes four compression presets optimized for different use cases:

- **MAXIMUM** (Default): 32kbps, mono, 16kHz - Smallest files, ideal for call recordings
- **HIGH**: 64kbps, mono, 22kHz - Good compression with better quality
- **MEDIUM**: 96kbps, mono, 44kHz - Balanced compression and quality
- **LOW**: 128kbps, stereo, 44kHz - Better quality, larger files

### üîß Audio Processing

The compression system applies several audio processing techniques:

1. **Sample Rate Conversion**: Reduces sample rate to optimize for speech content
2. **Channel Reduction**: Converts stereo to mono for call recordings
3. **Audio Normalization**: Optimizes audio levels for consistent volume
4. **Noise Reduction**: Basic noise gating to remove low-level background noise
5. **Dynamic Range Compression**: Reduces dynamic range for better compression efficiency

### üìä Compression Results

The system provides detailed compression statistics:

- Original file size
- Compressed file size
- Compression ratio percentage
- Processing time
- Estimated compression preview

## Technical Implementation

### Client-Side Processing

All audio processing happens in the browser using:

- **Web Audio API**: For audio decoding and processing
- **LameJS**: For MP3 encoding with custom bitrates
- **Custom DSP**: For audio enhancement and optimization

### Compression Pipeline

1. **Audio Loading**: Decode audio file using Web Audio API
2. **Audio Processing**: Apply sample rate conversion, normalization, noise reduction
3. **Audio Encoding**: Encode to MP3 with specified compression settings
4. **File Compression**: Apply additional gzip compression
5. **Upload**: Upload the doubly-compressed file

### Supported Formats

**Input Formats**:
- MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, OGG, FLAC, WebM

**Output Format**:
- MP3 (optimized for compression and compatibility)

## Usage

### In FileUpload Component

The compression feature is automatically enabled by default. Users can:

1. **Toggle Compression**: Enable/disable audio compression
2. **Select Preset**: Choose from four compression levels
3. **Preview Results**: See estimated compression ratios before upload
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track compression and upload progress

### Compression Settings UI

```tsx
// Example usage
<FileUpload 
  onUploadComplete={handleUploadComplete}
  userId={userId}
  // Compression is automatically enabled with MAXIMUM preset
/>
```

## Benefits

### üìâ Reduced File Sizes

- **Typical Compression**: 85-95% size reduction for call recordings
- **WAV Files**: Often compressed by 90%+ while maintaining speech clarity
- **MP3 Files**: Additional 50-70% compression through re-encoding

### ‚ö° Faster Uploads

- Smaller files upload significantly faster
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- Better experience on slow connections

### üí∞ Cost Savings

- Lower storage costs for cloud storage
- Reduced data transfer costs
- More efficient use of server resources

### üîä Optimized for Speech

- Settings specifically tuned for call recordings
- Maintains transcription accuracy
- Removes unnecessary audio fidelity for non-music content

## Performance Considerations

### Processing Time

- **Small files (< 10MB)**: 1-3 seconds
- **Medium files (10-50MB)**: 3-10 seconds
- **Large files (50-100MB)**: 10-30 seconds

### Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support with Web Audio API
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support with minor limitations
- **Mobile browsers**: Limited by device performance

### Memory Usage

- Peak memory usage: ~3x original file size
- Garbage collection happens after processing
- Large files (>100MB) may require processing in chunks

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Fallback Processing**: If audio compression fails, falls back to original file
2. **Format Detection**: Validates audio formats before processing
3. **Memory Management**: Prevents browser crashes from memory issues
4. **Progress Tracking**: Provides detailed status updates

## Configuration

### Default Settings

```typescript
const DEFAULT_COMPRESSION = {
  preset: 'MAXIMUM',
  enabled: true,
  showSettings: false
};
```

### Customization

Users can customize compression settings through the UI:

- Compression level selection
- Enable/disable compression
- Real-time compression estimates

## Monitoring and Analytics

The system tracks:

- Compression ratios achieved
- Processing times
- Success/failure rates
- User preference patterns

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

1. **Opus Codec Support**: Even better compression for modern browsers
2. **Background Processing**: Process files while user continues working
3. **Batch Processing**: Compress multiple files simultaneously
4. **Quality Presets**: More granular quality control
5. **Format Selection**: Allow users to choose output format

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure Web Audio API support
2. **Memory Limits**: Large files may fail on low-memory devices
3. **Format Support**: Some exotic audio formats may not be supported

### Debugging

Enable debug logging:

```javascript
console.log('[AudioCompressor] Debug mode enabled');
```

Check browser console for detailed compression logs and error messages.

## API Reference

### AudioCompressor Class

```typescript
class AudioCompressor {
  async compressAudio(file: File, settings: CompressionSettings): Promise<CompressionResult>
  static estimateCompressionRatio(file: File, settings: CompressionSettings): number
}
```

### Compression Presets

```typescript
const COMPRESSION_PRESETS = {
  MAXIMUM: { bitRate: 32, sampleRate: 16000, channels: 1 },
  HIGH: { bitRate: 64, sampleRate: 22050, channels: 1 },
  MEDIUM: { bitRate: 96, sampleRate: 44100, channels: 1 },
  LOW: { bitRate: 128, sampleRate: 44100, channels: 2 }
};
```

## Conclusion

The advanced audio compression feature provides significant benefits for the Sales Analyzer platform by reducing file sizes, improving upload speeds, and optimizing storage costs while maintaining the quality needed for accurate call analysis and transcription.
